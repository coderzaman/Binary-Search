# Binary Search Algorithm in C++

This is a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array.

## Description

The `binarySearch` function takes a sorted vector of integers and a target number as input and returns `true` if the number is found in the vector, and `false` otherwise.

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `binarySearch` function by sorting a vector of integers and then searching for a user-provided number.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```
   g++ -o binary_search main.cpp
   ```
3. Run the compiled executable. For example:
   ```
   ./main
   ```
4. Enter a number to search within the provided list.
5. The program will output whether the number is found or not found in the list.
